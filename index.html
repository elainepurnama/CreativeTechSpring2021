		<h2>Week 1: On "Programming Design Systems" by Rune Madsen</h2>
		<h3>"...graphic designers have always used systems in their work. We use grid systems to balance our layouts and color circles to pick colors with proper distance to each other. History has shown us that systems can cure the fear of the blank canvas..." - </h3>
		<p>I particularly like that an example here is given as a way to connect graphic design to systems. I think most of time, the connection between graphic design and systems can be unclear, as some people might ask "What does graphic design, or making things look good, have to do with systems?". This quote gives a direct example of how systems are used in such a discipline. However, the part I like the most about this quote is the last sentence. I agree that without having some sort of system, it can be intimidating to start on a design when the canvas is blank. Without a system, I sometimes ask myself: Where do I start? What colour should I choose? It is interesting how even on a blank canvas, having a system, even mentally, will help with starting a design, and sometimes even gives us more freedom to try different things.</p>

		<h3>"Rather than trying to establish some unified theory about why color behaves this way, Albers describes how students can repeat these experiments to experience it on their own."</h3>
		<p> I am quite fond of the way Albers allows experimentation for the sake of personal experience, rather than trying to establish a unified theory on color. Building upon what was talked about in the text, on the objectivity vs. subjectivity of the experience of colour, I think that it is important to note that there are psychological aspects to color theory that are "objective" and should be considered, however it is also important to allow the designer or user to experience color and color combinations themselves for a subjective point of view. Albers' way of teaching experiments for students to experience things on their own is important for the combination of an objective understanding of color theory and a subjective experience. </p>
